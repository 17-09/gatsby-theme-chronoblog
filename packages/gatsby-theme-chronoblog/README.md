# Chronoblog - Gatsby Theme

**WIP**
Gatsby theme for building blogs with MDX

```sh
npm i gatsby-theme-chronoblog
```

## TODO

- content-related dates/calendar
- simple installation and use for CMS [contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)
- comments for blog posts (disqus?)
- simple installation netlify.com
- link redirection
- simple theme-ui change (@theme-ui/\* presets)
- website link icon for preview link
- post `redirects`
- in home.mdx - the ability to create feeds-blocks with filters by hashtags,like this: ricostacruz.com/til
- component `contentMap` for MDX, with all Posts and Links and Pages of the site (in url links form) - by tags or/and dates. Examples: https://ricostacruz.com/til/ (by tags), https://tomcritchlow.com/writing/ (by years).
- `<LinkCard>` component for MDX - work as link, but looks as card and have title, image and description. This is for some important and special links (books, big projects etc.)
- years and dates like http://sidebar.io ?
- content type `podcast` for, so, podcasts - with player and links-icons to podcasts platforms (spotify, google podcasts, etc)
- feed **scrollspy** for dates - years and months
- `note` - item type for feed, like post, but need only `date`. No link too ful page (like 'reade more'), no cover image (but can have images), no title (but this is md so can have #). All content in feed. Similar to twitter tweets.
