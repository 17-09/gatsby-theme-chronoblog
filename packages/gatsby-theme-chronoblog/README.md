**WIP**

**⚠️ This theme is very unstable ⚠️**

The theme for gatsbyjs designed specifically for creating a personal site. The main idea of ​​Chronoblog is to allow you not only to write a personal blog, but also to keep a record of everything important that you have done.

I never liked that most blog systems were created exclusively with the expectation of long articles, and any other content always looked foreign in them, whether it was links to other sites, videos, podcasts, or even just short notes. On most blog systems, all this does not look organic.

But what if we make a blog theme based on a feed? Something like Twitter, but without restrictions, and in the form of a personal site?

In the feed, almost anything looks organic - links to your articles on any site, videos of your lectures, your projects, completed courses, interviews, podcasts in which you participated - all this can be placed in the Chronoblog feed and structured using tags.

At the same time, this is still a blog, Chronoblog can be used as a theme for creating a personal blog.

```sh
npm i gatsby-theme-chronoblog
```
