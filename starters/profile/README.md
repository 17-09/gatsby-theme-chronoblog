This starter will help you launch a personal website with a simple text feed on the main page. This starter looks simple and neat, but at the same time, it has great potential for organizing your content using tags, dates, and search.

The homepage is organized in compact feeds. The display of content in these feeds is based on the tags of this content (for example, only content with a `podcast` tag gets into the feed with podcasts).

The starter is based on the Gatsby Theme Chronoblog.

What is a Chronoblog?

> Chronoblog is a Gatsby js theme specifically designed to create a personal website. The main idea of ​​Chronoblog is to allow you not only to write a personal blog but also to keep a record of everything important that you have done.
