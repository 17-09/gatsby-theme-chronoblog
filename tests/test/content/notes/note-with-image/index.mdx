## Back in early 2013,

I was working at a small startup in San Francisco called Stitch Fix, alongside Adam Morse and a handful of others.

### We were designing and building out early versions of their marketing pages and some internal tools.

_Learning from the past_

The paradigm of atomic/functional/utility CSS has passed. I don't think there are any problems left to solve in this space, and, in my opinion, Tachyons has done the best job at it. **It's still a valid approach to styling an application, but if you're using a modern front-end stack with React.**

I wouldn't recommend using a CSS library like these to build out an application. Libraries like Styled Components and Emotion are tools much better suited to the job and will save you a lot of headache in the long run.
