This is a **post-footer.mdx** - this file lives here: `src/gatsby-theme-chronoblog/post-footer.mdx`.

Everything that will be written here will be displayed after **each post**.

Write your name here, your email, post your avatar, put links to your social networks.

Since this is `mdx` you can write js code here. But no one forces you to do this, you can treat this file like a regular Markdown.
