Welcome to the Chronoblog starter!

This text lives in a file: **`pages/index.mdx`** - replace it with what you want to see on the main page of your site. 🧐

The main idea of ​​the Chronoblog is to help you create your personal website. Collect in one place everything you have done and written.

You can think of the Chronoblog as a personal blog, but in addition to regular posts ✏️, you can post notes 📝 and links 🔗 to any materials. And all this with tags.

Another way to think about Chronoblog is something like RSS Feed - but this Feed is not for you, **but about you**.
