# Chronoblog ⌛

Welcome to the Chronoblog starter!

This text lives in a file: **`pages/index.mdx`** - replace it with what you want to see on the main page of your site. 🧐

The main idea of ​​the Chronoblog is to help you create your personal website. Collect in one place everything you have done and written.

You can think of the Chronoblog as a personal blog, but in addition to regular posts ✏️, you can post notes 📝 and links 🔗 to any materials.

Another way to think about Chronoblog is something like RSS Feed - but this Feed is not for you, **but about you**.

- Your posts. Do you have posts on the medium? On dev to?
- Your articles for online publications
- Interview with you
- Video with you
- Your presentations
- Your projects
- Your portfolio
- Scientific publications
- Podcasts - yours or just with your participation
- Your achievements - certificates, awards

All this can be placed on your personal website, in one feed, in chronological order ⌛ and tagged 🏷️.
